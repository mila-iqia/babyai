    The bot maintains a plan, represented as a stack of the so-called
    subgoals. The initial set of subgoals is generated from the instruction.
    The subgoals are then executed one after another, unless a change of
    plan is required (e.g. the location of the target object is not known
    or there other objects in the way). In this case, the bot changes the plan.

    The bot can also be used to advice a suboptimal agent, e.g. play the
    role of an oracle in algorithms like DAGGER. It changes the plan based on
    the actual action that the agent took.

    The main method of the bot (and the only one you are supposed to use) is `replan`.
