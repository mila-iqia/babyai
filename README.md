# BabyAI Platform

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mila-iqia/babyai.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mila-iqia/babyai)

A platform for simulating language learning with a human in the loop. This is an ongoing research project based at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/). If you use this platform in your research, please cite:

## Installation

Requirements:
- Python 3.5+
- OpenAI Gym
- NumPy
- PyQT5
- PyTorch 0.4.1+

Start by manually installing PyTorch. See the [PyTorch website](http://pytorch.org/)
for installation instructions specific to your platform.

Then, clone this repository and install the other dependencies with `pip3`:

```
git clone https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai.git
cd babyai
pip3 install --editable .
```

### Installation using Conda (Alternative Method)

If you are using conda, you can create a `babyai` environment with all the dependencies by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai.git
cd babyai
conda env create -f environment.yaml
source activate babyai
```

After that, execute the following commands to setup the environment.

```
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid.git
cd gym-minigrid
pip install --editable .
```

The last command installs the repository in editable mode. Move back to the `babyai` repository and install that in editable mode as well.

```
cd ../babyai
pip install --editable .
```

### Docker Container

A prebuilt docker image is available [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/maximecb/babyai/). You can download this image by executing:

```
docker pull maximecb/babyai
```

You should run the image with `nvidia-docker` (which allows you to use CUDA):

```
nvidia-docker run -it maximecb/babyai bash
```

Pretrained IL and RL models can be found in the `models` directory of the image.

### BabyAI Storage Path

Add this line to `.bashrc` (Linux), or `.bash_profile` (Mac).

```
export BABYAI_STORAGE='/<PATH>/<TO>/<BABYAI>/<REPOSITORY>/<PARENT>'
```

where `/<PATH>/<TO>/<BABYAI>/<REPOSITORY>/<PARENT>` is the folder where you typed `git clone https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai.git` earlier.

Models, logs and demos will be produced in this directory, in the folders `models`, `logs` and `demos` respectively.

### Demonstration Dataset

**NOTE 2018-10-18:** we are in the process of improving the heuristic agent (bot) and will be releasing a new dataset of higher-quality demonstrations soon.

Generating demonstrations takes a sizeable amount of computational resources. A gzipped archive containing the demonstrations used for the ICLR 2019 submission is [available here](http://lisaweb.iro.umontreal.ca/transfert/lisa/users/chevalma/iclr19-demos.tar.gz) (14GB download).

Once downloaded, extract the `.pkl` files to `/<PATH>/<TO>/<BABYAI>/<REPOSITORY>/<PARENT>/demos`.

## Structure of the Codebase

In `babyai`:
- `levels` contains the code for all levels
- `bot.py` is a heuristic stack-based bot that can solve all levels
- `imitation.py` is an imitation learning implementation
- `rl` contains an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) RL algorithm
- `model.py` contains the neural network code

In `scripts`:
- use `train_il.py` to train an agent with imitation learning, using demonstrations from the bot, from another agent or even provided by a human
- use `train_rl.py` to train an agent with reinforcement learning
- use `make_agent_demos.py` to generate demonstrations with the bot or with another agent
- use `make_human_demos.py` to make and save human demonstrations
- use `train_intelligent_expert.py` to train an agent with an interactive imitation learning algorithm that incrementally grows the training set by adding demonstrations for the missions that the agent currently fails
- use `evaluate.py` to evaluate a trained agent
- use `enjoy.py` to visualze an agent's behavior
- use `gui.py` or `test_mission_gen.py` to see example missions from BabyAI levels

## Usage

To run the interactive GUI application that illustrates the platform:

```
scripts/gui.py
```

The level being run can be selected with the `--env` option, eg:

```
scripts/gui.py --env BabyAI-UnlockPickup-v0
```

### Training

To train an RL agent run e.g.

```
scripts/train_rl.py --env BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0
```

Folders `logs/` and `models/` will be created in the current directory. The default name
for the model is chosen based on the level name, the current time and the other settings (e.g.
`BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0_ppo_expert_filmcnn_gru_mem_seed1_18-10-12-12-45-02`). You can also choose the model
name by setting `--model`. After 5 hours of training you should be getting a success rate of 97-99\%.
A machine readable log can be found in `logs/<MODEL>/log.csv`, a human readable in `logs/<MODEL>/log.log`.

To train an agent with imitation learning first make sure that you have your demonstrations in
`demos/<DEMOS>`. Then run e.g.

```
scripts/train_il.py --env BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0 --demos <DEMOS>
```

In the example above we run scripts from the root of the repository, but if you have installed BabyAI as
described above, you can also run all scripts with commands like `<PATH-TO-BABYAI-REPO>/scripts/train_il.py`.

### Evaluation

In the same directory where you trained your model run e.g.

```
scripts/evaluate.py --env BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0 --model <MODEL>
```

to evaluate the performance of your model named `<MODEL>` on 1000 episodes. If you want to see
your agent performing, run

```
scripts/enjoy.py --env BabyAI-GoToLocal-v0 --model <MODEL>
```

### The Levels

Documentation for the ICLR19 levels can be found in
[docs/iclr19_levels.md](docs/iclr19_levels.md).
There are also older levels documented in
[docs/bonus_levels.md](docs/bonus_levels.md).

### Troubleshooting

If you run into error messages relating to OpenAI gym or PyQT, it may be that the version of those libraries that you have installed is incompatible. You can try upgrading specific libraries with pip3, eg: `pip3 install --upgrade gym`. If the problem persists, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai/issues) on this repository and paste a *complete* error message, along with some information about your platform (are you running Windows, Mac, Linux? Are you running this on a Mila machine?).

## Instructions for Committers

## About this Project

BabyAI is an open-ended grounded language acquisition effort at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/). The current BabyAI platform was designed to study data-effiency of existing methods under the assumption that a human provides all teaching signals
(i.e. demonstrations, rewards, etc.). For more information, see the paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08272).
